Around the same time that the trees stopped blooming, townsfolk started seeing some spooky-looking shadows in the woods, and a few people who've gone out there have gone missing. I've asked Mr. Jenkins for help on sniffing out some clues for this case, but he just thinks we're a bunch of foolish meddling kids. Can we answer enough of his trivia questions to get to the bottom of this mystery before it's too late? I'll make sure to keep a lookout!"
